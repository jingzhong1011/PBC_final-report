# Ubike2.0 Information Crawler

### Introduction
This is a part of the group final report for the course "Programming for Business Computing in Python" in NTU (Semester: 109-Autumn).

My role in this final report was to use a web crawler to get real-time information about Ubike 2.0, such as geographic information about each station, available rental vehicles, and available return vehicles. We use these real-time information to help users recommend the nearest available Ubikes to their location and destination.

### Method
Use the simple method of web crawler: *beautifulsoup4* and *requests* to get the real-time information and conducting data collation.

### More about the project
The whole project is about the Restaurant Recommender Around NTU.

We collected restaurants around NTU and gave them the proper labeling. Users can choose the tags and our application will recommend some restaurants for them, futhermore, the application will give them the nearest Ubike2.0's information to their location and destination.
